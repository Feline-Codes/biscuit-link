# Cookie Jar _(Currently in Development)_

A PHP framework for people who do not want to waste time. Just `git clone` and `vagrant up` and you are running!

Due to the immaturity of this project it is not yet suitable for production environments, but feel free to hack away a new project and I will add it to the lists of projects!

Feel free to contribute too!
